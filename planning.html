			<h1> How to plan a perfect travel: from home to your destination </h1>
		</div>
		
		<br>
		
		<div class="planning">
			<h2> 1. Plan your budget. </h2>
			<p> Before planning the actual trip, check your budget first. You will be basing
			everything about the trip on your budget, like how long your adventure will be,
			who to bring, which places to stay, eat, travel to, and a lot more. </p>
		</div>
		
		<br>
		
		<div class="planning">
			<h2> 2. Decide on who to go with, the duration, and the destination. </h2>
			<p> You can choose to with your relatives, friends, or alone in a 3-week or 3-day
			trip. Make sure to take your budget and destination into consideration. For example,
			a popular honeymoon site, like Maldives, would be swarmed by couples, so a solo
			trip would not be the best choice. Or a family vacation wouldn't be too ideal on
			a place that is	party-centered, like Las Vegas.</p>
		</div>
		
		<br>
		
		<div class="planning">
			<h2> 3. Research </h2>
			<p> Not doing research may affect your travel. For example, you went to a beach
			destination without knowing that it would be rainy, or to someplace in the tropics
			during the hottest months, you won't be able to fully enjoy your trip. Another factor
			to consider would be the amount of tourists traveling; more tourists would mean longer
			lines and crowds at attractions, less tourists would mean higher prices and less chances
			of witnessing shows and attractions that are only available during peak season. Third,
			check visa requirements. Not all counrties need a visa to travel to, but if ever, apply
			for one in advance. Lastly, check the destinations you would want to go to; their business
			hours, peak hours, etc. Also, check their rules, regulations, laws, and beliefs of your
			destination to make sure that you are not violating anything. It would be also ideal
			to book tickets and create reservations in advance. These would help you create your
			itinerary. </p>
		</div>
		
		<br>
		
		<div class="planning">
			<h2> 4. Create an itinerary. (optional) </h2>
			<p> Itineraries are important, but not really necessary. Some travelers would prefer
			to have one, some wouldn't. But if you do want to, use your research to make one. </p>
		</div>		
		
		<br>
		
		<div class="planning">
			<h2> 5. Book your chosen transportation. </h2>
			<p> Some places can be traveled by boat, by bus, by plane, or other modes of 
			transportation. One of the most important things to consider when buying a ticket is
			when to buy. Some tickets are expensive when the trip is near and last-minute, but
			cheap when it is booked weeks or months away from the date. </p>
		</div>
		
		<br>
		
		<div class="planning">
			<h2> 6. Book an accomodation. </h2>
			<p> There are a lot of factors to consider when booking an accomodation like the
			duration of your stay, the location, transportation, and budget. If you plan to
			stay short-term, it is better to book an accomodation in advance to save time. 
			However, if you plan to stay for month/s, renting an apartment or hotel-hopping
			may be a good choice. For the location, it is better to stay a little farther from 
			the center of the city to avoid loud noises. Staying somewhere with accessible
			public transportation or a walkable neighborhood would also be ideal. </p>
		</div>
		
		<br>
		
		<div class="planning">
			<h2> 7. Pack! </h2>
			<p> First things to prepare would be your passport, tickets, cards, and other necessary
			papers. Include chargers, travel pillows, and your wallet. Next, pack your clothes,
			shoes (optional), and toiletries (in case the accomodation does not provide one). Make
			sure to not overpack, though. Take note that flights charge extra if you go over the
			weight limit. </p>
		</div>
		
		<br>
		
		<div class="planning">
			<h2> 8. Last-minute preparations </h2>
			<p> This is the part where last-minute arrangements are made. Look up for possible
			ways to have internet/data access while traveling. Purchase a local SIM card or go on
			roaming with your original SIM card are some of the ways to do so. Next, download 
			useful applications, like Google Maps, GlobalConvert, and Trail Wallet. Third, have 
			a plan for your budget (discussed in #1). Lastly, learn at least a few phrases if
			you are going to a foreign country. </p>
