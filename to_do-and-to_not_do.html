			<h2> DO'S: What <i> to do </i> when travelling? </h2>
				<ol>
					<li> <b> DO </b> research before going anywhere unfamiliar.
					<p> Learning a few things about the place, like a few phrases of their local language or some customs, can help make your travel smoother.
					Also, research on the cultures of your destination. Some acts that are not considered offensive in other countries may be in others. For example, 
					some countries in the Middle East, like Iran, considers the thumbs up sign as offensive, but not in several other countries. </p> </li> <br>

					<li> <b> DO </b> pack for all possible types of weather of your destination.
					<p> Check the weather status of your destination before packing your clothes. You obviously would not want to wear a large padded coat in the
					middle of June in the Egypt, or wear a sleeveless dress or crop top on a New York's December. Also, always remember to pack extra clothes, at
					least a day's worth of them, in case of emergencies. </p></li><br>
	
					<li> <b> DO </b> photocopy or memorize your passport information.
					<p> In case your passport gets stolen, lost, or damaged, it is safe to have a photocopy. Contact your country's embassy when this type of situation
					happens. Having a photocopy would make your identification easier and the replacement process much faster. </p></li>

			<h2> DON'TS: What <i> not to do </i> when travelling? </h2>
				<ol>
					<li> <b> DON'T </b> show or carry huge amounts of money in public.
					<p> Do not bring all of your money at once when going out. This one would be pretty self-explanatory. </p></li><br>
			
					<li> <b> DON'T </b> dress or act like a tourist.
					<p> As much as possible, try to blend in with the locals. It helps you avoid those who target obvious tourists. For sure, you wouldn't want to
					be scammed or be a victim of anything anywhere, more so in a foreign place. </p></li><br>
			
					<li> <b> DON'T </b> go to any places that looks suspicious.
					<p> Steer clear of areas that are isolated or dimly lit. If you want to walk around at night, make sure there are many people around you to avoid
					being in danger. As they say, "there is safety in numbers."</p></li>
