				<p> hello! i am kate angela, a fourteen year-old girl from the philippines!
				<br> welcome to my website! <br><br>
				as a kid, kate has been to many different places, local or international, 
				mostly because of her parents' love for travelling. later on, she grew
				to love it too! she and her parents, especially her mother, try to go to
				as much places as they can during their summer or christmas breaks.
				sometimes, her grandparents or cousins would tag along as well!
				<br><br> however, due to the current pandemic, it has been more than a year,
				since she has last travelled. she is hoping that the pandemic would soon
				end so that she can go to and experience more of her dream destinations.
